You are receiving a question from a user of type: **{user_type}**.

Question:
---
{question}

Your job is to classify this question into the correct Qaddemly system **feature** based on the user's intent.

Return ONLY ONE of the following labels:

- RECOMMENDATION
- MATCHING_SCORE
- COVER_LETTER
- RESUME_BUILDER
- JOB_SEARCH
- COMPANY_SEARCH
- APPLICATION_TRACKING
- PROFILE
- NOTIFICATIONS
- MESSAGING
- OTHER

💡 REMEMBER:
- Only use RECOMMENDATION if the user is explicitly asking to use the system’s automated job-matching feature.
- If the user is asking for career **advice** or suggestions from the AI/chatbot (e.g., “What jobs suit me?”), return OTHER.
- Be strict and accurate. Output one UPPERCASE value only — no punctuation.

Respond ONLY with the label from the list above.
